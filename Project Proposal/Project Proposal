Project Proposal

AirBnB New User Bookings

This project was floated on Kaggle by AirBnb as a part of recruiting exercise.

I have chosen the same data set, although my approach will be much more inclined as per the workshop requirements and my understanding of the concepts.

Below is the description as per the project proposal format

1. The ultimate goal of this project will be to predict the destination country for a new user booking.

2. The client in this case would be AirBnB, and they care about it because it will give them a great deal of idea as in which country their next customer will
pick for a booking and hence it will give them a better idea to customize the experience for the user and ultimately provide a cutting edge service as per any industry standard.

3. Data I will be using is uploaded on Kaggle website. It contains a lot of user data as well the sessions data which has a lot of varibales including the time spend, date of account creation, and similarly 14 more details for more than 1,00,00,000 sessions. Link for the same is below:

4. My approach would be to first explore the data thoroughly as this data set contains a lot of variables, hence exploration will be a key here. After then, I would try to figure out the key variables which may lead to a particular destination country.

5. Deliverables would be full code for all the trials and all the necessary details along with the definitions of all the varibles and functions used.
