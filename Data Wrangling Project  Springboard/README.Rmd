### This project just has one R script for whole code.

### run_analysis.R - This file contains the code for the Data Wrangling Project which is a part of Springboard's Foundations of Data Science Workshop.

### CodeBook.md - This file contains the full code with the explanation for the functions used. This is very much similar to the script with a little editing.
